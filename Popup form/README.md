# Form with Smooth Transition and Dynamic Display

This project demonstrates a form that appears and disappears dynamically with a smooth transition effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The transition includes opacity and scale animations to create a modern and visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Display**: The form can be toggled on and off by clicking a button or a close icon.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Includes a fade-in and fade-out effect with scaling for seamless visibility changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is centered and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist design with user-friendly input fields and buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for the button and form structure.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, animations, and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for toggling the form's visibility dynamically.

## How It Works

1. The **button** triggers the `openForm()` function to show the form.
2. The **close icon** inside the form triggers the `closeForm()` function to hide the form.
3. CSS transitions handle the smooth fade-in and fade-out effect with scaling.

### CSS Transition Details

- The `opacity` property transitions for fading effects.
- The `transform: scale()` property adds a scaling animation for a polished look.
- `transition` properties ensure smooth changes over 0.3 seconds.
